- 👋 Hi, I’m @aswinpaul
- I’m interested in brain-inspired algorithms for machine learning.
- :sparkles: Education:
- I am a physicist by training and completed my PhD jointly from IIT Bombay and Monash University in October 2024.
- Thesis title: Towards computationally efficient and explainable active inference.
- PhD thesis supervisor (Monash): [Prof Adeel Razi](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/adeel-razi).
- PhD thesis supervisor (IITB): [Prof Manoj Gopalkrishnan](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=130538).
- :sparkles: Current Employment:
- Currently, I work with [VERSES AI](https://www.verses.ai/) as a machine learning researcher with [Prof Christopher Buckley](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p108674-christopher-buckley) and team.
